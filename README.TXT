PROJECT TITLE: Sudoku
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: a program that generates unique sudoku puzzles, and let's the user solve them.
VERSION or DATE: 5/8
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the main method of the launcher class. 
AUTHORS: Kobi Hall
USER INSTRUCTIONS: After the program is open generate a new board, and fill in values of the sudoku grid. Press the toggle pencil marks button if there are multiple values that a cell might have (the program will update these as you make guesses).
			It's considered cheating, but if the puzzle is too hard you can have the program display all the possible pencil marks to make it easier.
